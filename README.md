Alien Invasion Project: I used the Pygame package to develop a 2D game. 
The goal of the game is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen, in levels that increase in speed and difficulty.
This is my first interactive project which taught me new skills in the Python language. This compiled on the first half of the book I used to learn this new skillset.
